A python project designed to analyze and visualize football data by comparing the performance
of two teams and generating a detailed PDF report that includes plots and textual analysis.
The program is organized into several scripts, each handling a specific part of the workflow.

# Installation

### Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/alexanderhepburn/FootballResults.git

### Navigate to the project directory

    cd FootballResults

### Install the required dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage and Features

1. To start the program, run the ```run.py``` script
2. The program will ask you to input a command
3. To get an overview of the available commands, input ```help```
4. Choose one of the following features:

- ```analyse``` create a report with two football teams of your choice
- ```teams``` view the available teams in your selected league
- ```settings``` view and change your current settings (you can change the years for the statistics here or change the
  preferred league)
- ```update_data``` update all data manually

5. After you analyse two teams of your choice, the program will automatically create a PDF document of the football
   statistics on your local drive
6. You can repeat the steps if you want to analyse different teams in different leagues

# Debugging

If the programm has any errors, try creating a virtual environment and installing all requirements:

    python3 -m venv myenv

Replace myenv with your environment name and run the environment:

    source myenv/bin/activate

Install the requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the script (make sure you are in the FootballResults directory):

    python3 run.py

# How the Program Works

## Key Components and Their Interactions

1. Main script ```run.py```

- **Purpose:** Entry point for the program.
- **Functionality:**
  Calls ```setup_program.setup_program()``` to install dependencies and create necessary directories.
  Runs the main loop provided by ```command_manager.run_program()``` to handle user inputs.

2. Setup ```setup_program.py```

- **Purpose:** Sets up the program environment.
- **Functionality:**
  Installs required dependencies from ```requirements.txt``` using ```subprocess```.
  Creates ```tmp``` and ```exports``` directories if they do not exist.
  Checks if the data directory exists and calls ```network_manager.get_all_data()``` if data needs to be downloaded.

3. Command management ```command.py```, ```commands.py```, ```command_manager.py```

- **Purpose:** Manages user commands.
- **Classes and Functions:**
    - ```Command``` Abstract base class for all commands. Implements common attributes and abstract
      method ```execute()```.
    - ```get_commands()``` Returns a list of command
      instances (```Analyse```, ```Teams```, ```UpdateData```, ```Settings```).
    - ```run_program()``` Main loop that prompts the user for commands, matches the input with available commands, and
      executes the corresponding commandâ€™s ```execute()``` method.
      Handles special commands like ```help``` to list all commands and ```end``` to terminate the program.

4. Data management ```data_manager.py```, ```network_manager.py```

- **Purpose:** Handles data retrieval, downloading, and preparation.
- **Functions:**
    - ```data_manager.py```
        - ```get_all_data()``` Reads CSV files from the ```data``` directory, combines them into a DataFrame, and
          filters based on user settings.
        - ```get_all_teams()``` Extracts and returns a list of unique team names from the data.
        - ```get_data_with_columns()``` Retrieves and aggregates specific columns of data for the selected teams.
    - ```etwork_manager.py```
        - ```get_all_data()``` Downloads football data for all years and leagues, saves them as CSV files in
          the ```data``` directory.

5. PDF creation ```pdf_creator.py```

- **Purpose:** Generates a PDF report.
- **Function:** ```create_pdf()``` Takes the team names and text content, creates a PDF with this information, and
  embeds plots generated by the ```Plot``` class.

6. Plotting ```plot.py```

- **Purpose:** Generates visual plots comparing team performance metrics.
- **Class:** ```Plot```
    - **Methods:**
        - ```__init__()``` Initializes the ```Plot``` object with data and team information, then
          calls ```plot_bars()``` to create all required plots.
        - ```create_bar()``` Creates individual bar plots for each specified metric and saves them as images.
        - ```plot_bars()``` Iterates through the specified metrics, extracts the relevant data for the two teams, and
          calls ```create_bar()``` for each metric.

7. Analysis ```analyse.py```

- **Purpose:** Orchestrates the analysis and report generation process.
- **Class:** ```Analyse```
    - **Method:** ```execute():```
        - Prompts the user to input two team names.
        - Validates the input and ensures two unique teams are selected.
        - Calls ```analyse.analyse()``` to generate the report.
        - Opens the generated PDF report using ```system_handling.open_file()```.

8. Text Generation ```text_generator.py```

- **Purpose:** Generates textual analysis for the PDF report.
- **Functions:**
    - ```generate_text()``` Placeholder function to generate text content for the report.
- **Helper functions:** Calculate various statistics like games played, overall stats, win percentages, average goals,
  card counts, shot accuracy, and correlations.
    - ```T_generate_text()``` Compiles the calculated statistics into a comprehensive text format for inclusion in the
      PDF report.

9. Settings
   Management ```settings_manager.py```, ```settings_object.py```, ```settings_option.py```, ```user_settings.py```

- **Purpose:** Manages user settings.
- **Classes:**
    - **```SettingsManager```**
        - Manages settings initialization, reset, and refresh.
        - Provides methods to update settings and save them to a JSON file.
    - **```SettingsObject```**
        - Represents user settings with attributes for the starting year, ending year, and selected league.
        - Provides methods to load default and user-defined settings from a JSON file.
    - **```SettingsOption```**, **```RangeSettingsOption```**, **```ListSettingsOption**```
        - Represent different types of settings options.
        - Provide methods to validate and display setting options.
    - **```UserSettings```**
        - Singleton class that provides access to the current settings instance and updates settings.

10. Utility ```system_handling.py```

- **Purpose:** Handles system-specific tasks.
- **Function:**
    - ```open_file()``` Opens a file using the default application based on the operating system.

# Limitations of the Program

- Data Source: The program uses data from https://www.football-data.co.uk
- Date Range: Analysis is limited to data from 2010 to 2024.
- Data Variability: The available data can vary by year, with some parameters not being recorded since 2010. There may
  also be gaps in the data if a team was relegated from a league.

# Ideas for Future Improvement

1. Enhanced data visualization:
    - Interactive plots: Use libraries like Plotly or Bokeh to create interactive plots, allowing users to hover over
      data points for detailed insights and dynamic data exploration.
      Expanded data analysis:

2. Advanced metrics:
    - Introduce advanced football metrics such as expected goals, passing accuracy, and possession percentage to provide
      deeper insights into team and player performance.

3. User interface enhancements:graphical user interface (GUI):
    - Develop a user-friendly GUI using frameworks like Tkinter, PyQt, or a web-based interface with Flask/Django to
      improve accessibility and ease of use.
